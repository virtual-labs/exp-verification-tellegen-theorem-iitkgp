								<ol type="1">
									<li>Connect the circuit as shown in the circuit diagram above, keeping the switches open and resistance at their maximum positions. </li>
									<br><li><b>Case 1: </b>In presence of both the sources<br>
									Select switch of S<sub>1</sub> to Power and S<sub>2</sub> to Power and switch on the supply to get the ammeter readings.
									Observe the power supplied in +ve and power dissipated in -ve by the elements and voltage source for this condition.<br></li>
									<br>
									<li><b>Case-2:</b> In presence of V<sub>1</sub> only
									 <br> Select switch of S<sub>1</sub> to Power and S<sub>2</sub> to short and switch on the supply. Read the corresponding power values as done in the above case.<br>
									 <br></li>
									<li><b>Case-3: </b>In presence of V<sub>2</sub> only
									 <br>Select switch of S<sub>1</sub> to Short and S<sub>2</sub> to switch on the supply.
									 Read the corresponding power values. <br><br> 
									 Calculate the power consumed or delivered by each element for each case and 
									 check if power absorbed = power delivered. This  proves the Tellegen's theorem. </li>
